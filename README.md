## How to use

Just use a Jupyter notebook and edit your cells.

When you want to write some N4L notes, add a new cell of type **raw**
that begins with:

        #| n4l

At the end of your notebook, add a Python code cell:

        import nbsstorytime; nbsstorytime.nbsstorytime_export() 

This cell will export the content of all your N4L cells content into a
new file called with the same name as your notebook, but with a .n4l
extension”
