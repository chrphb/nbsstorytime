## How to use

Just use Jupyter notebook and edit your cells.

When you want to write some N4L notes, add a new cell of type **raw**
which starts by the line:

        #| n4l

At the end of your notebook, you can add the Python code cell:

        import nbsstorytime; nbsstorytime.nbsstorytime_export() 

This cell will export all your N4L cells content into a new file called
with the same name as your notebook and the extension “.n4l”
